**Understanding Data Security** - data is the most valuable asset held by many organizations
- Data Security Controls:
	- Clear policies and procedures covering data use and security
	- Encryption to protect sensitive information
	- File system permission restrictions
	- Geographic restrictions
	- Segmentation and other network security controls

**Data Types**
- *Data Inventories* - track the location of data storage, processing, and transmission
	- Data Inventory Contents:
		- Personally identifiable information (PII)
		- Protected health information (PHI)
		- Financial information
		- Intellectual property
		- Legal information
		- Regulated information
	Include both human-readable and non-human-readable information in your inventory

**Data Anonymization** - removing identifying information from records reduces risk
- *Deidentification* - removes obvious identifiers
- *Anonymization* - removes the possibility of identification
Data risk minimization reduces risk very effectively

**Data Obfuscation**
- *Data Obfuscation* - transforms personally identifying information into a form where it is no longer possible to tie it to an individual person
	- *Hashing* - replaces sensitive fields with hash values
		- *Rainbow Table Attack* - compares hash values with precomputed hashes
	- *Tokenization* - replaces sensitive fields with a random identifier
	- *Masking* - redacts sensitive information from a file

**Information Classification** - classifying information helps employees understand security requirements
- *Data Classification Policies* - assign information to categories known as classifications that determine storage, handling, and access requirements
	- Assign Classifications Based On:
		- Sensitivity of information
		- Criticality of information
	The exam objectives list the common classifications: sensitive: confidential, public, restricted, private, and critical
- Sensitive Customer Information:
	- Personally identifiable information (PII)
	- Financial information
	- Health information
- *Labeling Requirements* - identify sensitive information
Securely dispose of information when no longer needed, classification drives cloud security decisions, classifying information helps employees understand security requirements
