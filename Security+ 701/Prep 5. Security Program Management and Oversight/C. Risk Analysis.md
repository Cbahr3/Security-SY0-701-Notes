**Risk Assessment** - organizations face a wide variety of cybersecurity risks
- *Risk Assessment* - identifies and prioritizes risks
- *Threat* - external force jeopardizing security
- *Threat Vectors* - are the specific methods that threats use to exploit a vulnerability
- *Vulnerability* - weakness in security controls
- *Risks* - are the combination of a vulnerability and a corresponding threat
- *Impact* - amount of expected damage
- Timing of Risks Assessments:
	- One-time risk assessment
	- Ad hoc risk assessment
	- Recurring risk assessment
	- Continuous risk assessment
- *Qualitative Risk Assessment* - use subjective ratings to evaluate risk likelihood and impact
- *Quantitative Risk Assessment* - uses objective numeric ratings to evaluate risk likelihood and impact

**Quantitative Risk Assessment** - quantitative risk assessments aid in data-driven decision-making, perform quantitative risk assessment for a single risk and asset pair
- *Asset Value (AV)* - the dollar value of an asset
	- Asset Valuation Techniques:
		- Original cost
		- Depreciated cost
		- Replacement cost
- *Exposure Factor (EF)* - expected percentage of damage to an asset
- *Single-Loss Expectancy (SLE)* - expected dollar loss if a risk occurs one time, AV * EF = SLE
- *Annualized Rate of Occurrence (ARO)* - number of times a risk is expected to occur each year
- *Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE)* - expected dollar loss from a risk in any given year, SLE * ARO = ALE
Time to restore service depends upon whether a component is repairable
- *Mean Time to Failure (MTTF)* - average time a nonrepairable component will last
- *Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)* - average time gap between failures of a repairable component
- *Mean Time to Repair (MTTR)* - average time required to return a repairable component to service

**Business Impact Analysis**
- *Cost Benefit Analysis* - is the cloud worth it?
	- Cost Factors at Scale:
		- Electricity costs
		- Data center facility rental/acquisition/maintenance
		- Training costs
		- Consulting services
		- Staff time
	- Intangible Benefits:
		- Increased productivity and agility
		- Improved scalability and elasticity
		- Faster access to emerging technologies
		- Transition from capital to operational expenditures
		- Fun!

**Risk Treatment Options**
- *Risk Management/Treatment* - this is a process of systematically analyzing potential responses to each risk and implementing strategies to control those risks appropriately
	- Risk Management Strategies
		- *Risk Avoidance* - changes the organization's business practices
		- *Risk Transference* - shifts the impact of a risk to another organization
		- *Risk Mitigation* - reduces the likelihood or impact of the risk
		- *Risk Acceptance* - accepts the risk without taking further action, risk acceptance may require an exemption or exception to policies or standards
	- *Risk Profile* - the full set of risks facing an organization
The organization's risk appetite describes how much risk it is willing to accept
- Risk Appetites:
	- *Expansionary Risk Appetites* - involve a willingness to take on higher levels of risk
	- *Neutral Risk Appetites* - take a balanced approach to risk
	- *Conservative Risk Appetites* - focus on maintaining stability and protecting assets
- *Risk Threshold* - the level at which risk becomes unacceptable
- *Risk Tolerance* - the organization's ability to withstand risks and continue operations

**Risk Visibility and Reporting** - risk visibility and reporting techniques document and track risks over time
- *Risk Register* - tracks risk information
	- Risk Register Contents:
		- Description
		- Category
		- Risk owner
		- Probability and impact
		- Risk rating
		- Risk management actions
	- Risk Register Information Sources:
		- Risk assessment results
		- Audit findings
		- Team member output
		- *Threat intelligence* - shares risk information, threat intelligence may be used both strategically and operationally

**Ongoing Risk Assessment** - risk management is an ongoing process
- *Risk Control Assessments* - look at a single point in time, test control effectiveness
	- Measuring Control Effectiveness:
		- Compromised end-user accounts
		- Vulnerabilities in public-facing systems
		- Critical findings in initial web application scans
		- Data breaches requiring notification
Security programs should embrace a spirit of continuous improvement

**Security Metrics** - use metrics to evaluate your security program effectiveness, security metrics should be defined in advance
- *Key Performance Indicator (KPIs)* - Â a quantifiable measure of performance over time for a specific objective
	- ITIL Security KPIs:
		- Decrease in breaches
		- Decrease in breach impact
		- Increase in strong SLAs
		- Number of new controls
		- Time to implement controls
		- Number of major incidents
		- Number of incident-related outages
		- Number of training events
		- Number of shortcomings
- *Key Goal Indicator (KGIs)* - a metric used to measure the progress towards a specific goal or objective
- *Key Risk Indicator (KRIs)* - a metric for measuring the likelihood that the combined probability of an event and its consequences will exceed the organization's risk appetite and have a profoundly negative impact on an organization's ability to be successful
	- KRI Criteria:
		- Business impact
		- Effort to implement, measure, and support
		- Reliability
		- Sensitivity
