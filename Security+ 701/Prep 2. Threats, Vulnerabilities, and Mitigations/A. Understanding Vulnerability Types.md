**Vulnerability Impact** - vulnerabilities impact the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information
- *Disclosure Attacks* - seek to undermine confidentiality
	- *Data breaches* - violations of confidentiality
- *Alteration Attacks* - seek to undermine integrity
- *Denial Attacks* - seek to undermine availability
We group risks to our organizations into several different categories:
- *Financial Risks* - involve monetary loss to the organization
- *Reputational Risks* - impacts how stakeholders view our organization
- *Strategic Risks* - jeopardizes our ability to meet our major goals and objectives
- *Operational Risks* - affects our ability to carry out day-to-day activities
- *Compliance Risks* - involves potential violations of laws or regulations

**Supply Chain Vulnerabilities** - running products that lack vendor support introduces significant security risks. there are a few terms for the stages of vendors stopping support:
1. *End of Sale* - the product will no longer be offered to purchase, but the vendor will support existing customers
2. *End of Support* - the vendor will reduce or eliminate support for existing users of the product
3. *End of Life* - the vendor will no longer provide any support or updates for the product
Vendors may fail to provide adequate support for existing products, vendors may not disclose the use of embedded systems, mitigate risks associated with data storage and other vendor dependencies, the sources of risks includes:
- Hardware providers
- Software providers
	- Client-based
	- Agentless
- MSPs (Managed Service Providers)

**Configuration Vulnerabilities** - default configurations may contain misconfigured firewalls, unnecessarily open permissions, guest accounts, default passwords, or unsecured root accounts, follow documented security standards and baselines when configuring systems and applications, some vulnerabilities related to cryptography include:
- Weak cipher suites
- Weak cryptographic protocol implementations
- Poor key management
- Poor certificate management
Patch management for these items are important as well:
- Operating systems
- Applications
- Firmware
Carefully manage the permissions assigned to accounts to prevent accidental or intentional misuse

**Architectural Vulnerabilities** - arise when a system is improperly designed, 
- *IT Architecture* - processes and practices used to design systems
incorporate security early, avoid bolt-on security requirements, untrained users and weak business processes can be just as dangerous as technical flaws
- *System Sprawl* - new devices are connected to a network, but old devices are not promptly disconnected, leading to security vulnerabilities, system sprawl is even riskier when assets are undocumented
Avoid using legacy hardware and firmware components
