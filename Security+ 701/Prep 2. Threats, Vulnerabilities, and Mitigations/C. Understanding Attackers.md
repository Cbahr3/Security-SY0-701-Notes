**Cybersecurity Adversaries** - cybersecurity threats vary significantly, attackers vary based upon:
- Internal vs. External Attackers
- Level of Sophistication
- Access to Resources
- Motivation
- Intent
Types of attackers include:
- *Unskilled attackers* - simply reuse hacking tools developed by others
- *Hacktivists* - seek to use hacking tools to advance political and social agendas
- *Criminal Syndicates & Organized Crime Groups* - use hacking tools such as ransomware for financial gain
- *Competitors* - may use hacking tools and techniques for corporate espionage purposes
- *Nation-state actors* - sponsor highly sophisticated APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) groups
Categories to describe the types of hackers include:
- *White Hats/Authorized* - operate with permission and good intent
- *Black Hats/Unauthorized* - operate illegally with malicious intent
- *Grey Hats/Semi-authorized* - operate without permission but with good intent

**Attacker Motivations** - attackers have many different objectives
- *Data Exfiltration* - involves stealing sensitive information
- *Espionage* - involves stealing data for the benefit of a government or corporation
- *Service Disruption* - impedes the normal operation of systems
- *Blackmail* - is an attempt to obtain a ransom from organizations trying to avoid legal or reputational damage
- Many attackers simply try to achieve financial gain
- *Ethical Hacking* - involves the authorized penetration of systems by cybersecurity professionals
- *Revenge Attacks* - occur when disgruntled employees or other insiders strike back
- The goal of some attacks is simply to cause chaos
- *Cyberwarfare Attacks* - target power grids and other critical infrastructure

**Preventing Insider Threats** - the most costly and dangerous attacks are perpetrated by insiders
- *Insider Threat* - risk of internal compromise, insider attacks often occur at the hands of executives, IT professionals, and other trusted users
	- HR Practices Control Insider Threats
		- Perform background checks to uncover past legal issues
		- Give users only the permissions that they need
		- Require multiple users to carry out sensitive operations
		- Implement mandatory vacations for critical staff
	- *Shadow IT* - exposes the organization to risk from the use of unapproved technology services

**Attack Vectors** - provide an attack path, common attack vectors include:
- Images and other files may be infected with malicious code
- Attackers use email to send phishing messages and malicious content
- Message-based attacks may also spread over SMS and instant messaging
- Voice calls may be used during phishing attacks
- Social media can spread malware and be used as part of an influence campaign
- Flash drives and other removable media may contain malware that triggers when inserted into a new device
- USB cables can also contain malicious content in an embedded chip
- Card skimmers read magnetic stripes, which may then be used in card cloning attacks
- Attackers scan cloud services for improperly secured content and systems
- Assume that attackers can take control of anything they can physically touch
- Tampering with devices in the supply chain allows attackers to insert backdoors
- Wireless networks allow attackers to remotely attack an organization's network

**Zero-day Attacks** - patches protect against many cybersecurity vulnerabilities, undiscovered security vulnerabilities lurk in existing code
- *Ethical Disclosure*
	1. Notify the vendor of the vulnerability
	2. Provide the vendor a reasonable amount of time to create a patch
	3. Disclose the vulnerability publicly
- *Zero-Day Vulnerability* - a vulnerability in a product that has been discovered by at least one researcher but has not yet been patched by the vendor
	- *Window of Vulnerability* - the time between the discovery of a zero-day vulnerability and the release of a security update
	- *APTs (Advanced Persistent Threats)* - are well-funded and highly skilled, are typically government sponsored, have access to zero days and other sophisticated weapons, work methodically to gain access to a target
		- Defenses against APTs
			- Build a strong security foundation
			- Implement strong encryption
			- Use rigorous monitoring
