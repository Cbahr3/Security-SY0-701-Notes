**Comparing Viruses, Worms, and Trojans** - Every piece of malware will have two components:
1. *Propagation Mechanism* - the way that a malware object spreads
2. *Payload* - the malicious action that the malware performs
The three common types of malware include:
- *Viruses* - spread by human action
- *Worms* - spread by themselves
	- *The RTM Worm* - was the first major worm outbreak; in 1988, infected ~10% of the internet, was an eye-opening event for security
	- *Stuxnet* - created in 2010, infiltrated Iranian nuclear facility, crossed the virtual/physical barrier, damaged uranium enrichment equipment
- *Trojan Horses* - disguise themselves as beneficial programs, act as advertised when they are run, deliver their malicious payload behind the scenes
- *RAT (Remote Access Trojans)* - provide backdoors to hacked systems

**Malware Payloads** - the three different types of malware payloads include:
- *Spyware* - gathers information without the user's knowledge or consent, logging keystrokes, monitoring web browsing, searching hard drives and cloud storage
	- *Bloatware* - slipped onto a system by other software installers
- *Ransomware* - blocks access to data
	- *WannaCry* - struck in 2017, exploited the EternalBlue Windows vulnerability, encrypts files, demands Bitcoin ransom
	- *LockBit* - continues to infect systems today
- *Crypto-malware* - mines cryptocurrency
There are many ways to prevent malware such as:
- Anti-malware software
- Security patches
- User education

**Understanding Backdoors and Logic Bombs** - some malware embeds itself in other programs
- *Backdoor* - provides workaround access, backdoor mechanisms include:
	- Hardcoded accounts
	- Default passwords
	- Unknown access channels
- *Logic Bomb* - delivers a triggered payload, the conditions for logic bombs include:
	- Date/time reached
	- File contents
	- API call results

**Looking At Advanced Malware** - some malware authors use sophisticated techniques
- *The Root Account* - a special superuser account that provides unrestricted access to system resources
-  *Rootkits* - escalate user privileges
	- Rootkit Payloads
		- Backdoors
		- Botnet agents
		- Adware/spyware
		- Antitheft mechanisms
	- User Mode vs. Kernel Mode
		- *User mode rootkits*
			- Run with normal user privileges
			- Are easy to write and difficult to detect
		- *Kernel mode rootkits*
			- Run with system privileges
			- Are difficult to write and easy to detect
- *Fileless Viruses* - remain in memory, fileless techniques include:
	- Microsoft Office macros
	- JavaScript code
	- Windows Registry persistence

**Understanding Botnets** - botnets steal computing power, network bandwidth, and storage capacity
- Botnet - network of infected machines, malware target is added to botnet once infected
	- Botnets are used for:
		- Renting out computing power
		- Delivering spam
		- Engaging in DDoS attacks
		- Mining Bitcoin
		- Waging brute force attacks
	- Botnet Command and Control
		- Command and control network relay orders
		- Communication must be indirect and redundant
		- (IRC) Internet Relay Chat
		- Twitter
		- Peer to peer within the botnet

**Malicious Script Execution** - a script is a sequence of instructions written in a programming language to automate our work
- *Shell Scripts* - run at the command line and integrate with the operating system
- *Application Scripts* - run within a software application and integrate with that application
- *Programming Languages* - allow the creation of general purpose code
Attackers may write scripts to perform malicious tasks, common scripting languages include:
- *Bash* - a scripting language used on Linux and Mac systems
- *PowerShell* - provides scripting capabilities for Windows systems
- *Visual Basic for Applications* - a macro scripting language used with Microsoft Office
- *Python* - a general purpose programming language used to create a diverse set of scripts
