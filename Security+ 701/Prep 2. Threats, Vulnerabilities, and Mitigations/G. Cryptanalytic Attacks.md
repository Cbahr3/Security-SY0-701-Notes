**Brute Force Attacks** - attackers seek to break the security of cryptographic systems
- *Brute-Force Attacks* - repeatedly guess keys, brute-force attacks are also called known ciphertext attacks
- *Keyspace* - the set of all possible encryption keys usable with an algorithm
Modern algorithms aren't susceptible to brute-force attacks, flawed algorithms may be vulnerable to brute-force attacks

**Knowledge-Based Attacks** - attacks become more efficient with a little knowledge
- *Frequency Analysis* - detects patterns in ciphertext
- *Known Plaintext Attack* - attacker has access to an unencrypted message
- *Chosen Plaintext Attack* - attacker can create an encrypted message of their choice
- *Birthday Attack* - attacker finds two inputs with the same hash values

**Limitations of Encryption Algorithms** - every encryption algorithm has some weakness, some algorithms are faster than others, longer keys lead to stronger security, longer keys require more computing power, some key choices may have inherent flaws, reusing the same key facilitates cryptanalytic attacks, cryptographic algorithms and keys have limited longevity
- *Entropy* - reduces the predictability of cryptographic methods
- *Downgrade Attacks* - remove or weaken encryption
