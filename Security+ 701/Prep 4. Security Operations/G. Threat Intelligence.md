**Threat Intelligence** - threat intelligence allows teams to stay-up-to-date on current risks
- *Threat Intelligence* - threat intelligence is the set of activities that an organization undertakes to educate itself about changes in the cybersecurity threat landscape and adapt security controls based on that information
- *Open-Source Intelligence* - uses public information
	- Open-Source Intelligence:
		- Security websites
		- Vulnerability databases
		- News media
		- Social media
		- Dark web
		- Information-sharing centers
		- File repositories
		- Code repositories
		- Security researchers
- *Email Address Harvesting* - searches for valid addresses
Many security companies offer proprietary and closed-source threat intelligence solutions
- *Timeliness* - how promptly is threat intelligence delivered?
- *Accuracy* - is the data correct?
- *Reliability* - is the provider consistent?

**Intelligence Sharing**
- Functions Supported by Intelligence:
	- Incident response
	- Vulnerability management
	- Risk management
	- Security engineering
	- Detection and monitoring
- *Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs)* - place for companies in different industries to share threat intelligence data

**Threat Hunting** - cybersecurity  professionals once saw their roles as building impenetrable defenses, in today's threat landscape, we make the assumption of compromise
- *Threat Hunting* - threat hunting is an organized, systematic approach to seeking out indicators of compromise on networks using expertise and analytic techniques
Threat hunters need to think like their adversaries, begin by establishing a hypothesis
- Indicators of Compromise:
	- Unusual binary files
	- Unexpected processes or resource consumption
	- Deviations in network traffic
	- Unexplained log entries
	- Unapproved configuration changes
After discovering a compromise, move into incident response
