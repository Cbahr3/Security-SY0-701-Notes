**Developing Security Baselines**
- *Security Baselines* - provide a set of minimum standards for systems
	- Baseline Security Standard Elements:
		- Administered by a named individual
		- Protected against unauthorized access
		- Doesn't jeopardize other systems or data
		- Remains under positive control
		- Complies with data security requirements
Baselines are generic, they cover an uncertain future, baselines may include specific requirements for handling different categories of information
- Specific Security Standards:
	- Operating systems
	- Mobile devices
	- Network infrastructure components
	- Appliances
- *System Configuration Managers* - automate policy deployment
Monitoring is critical, watch for baseline deviations

**Leveraging Industry Standards** - industry standards provide an excellent starting point for securing systems
- Sources of Security Standards:
	- Vendors
	- Independent organizations

**Customizing Security Standards** - organizations may customize industry standards to meet their own requirements, document the reasons for any deviations, more stringent settings may be required based on data sensitivity or system criticality
