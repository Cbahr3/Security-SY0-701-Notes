**Mobile Connection Methods** - mobile devices connect to networks in many different ways
- *Cellular Networks* - available in most urban and suburban areas, cover distances of 20-plus miles, rated according to the generation of service
- *Wi-Fi Networks* - cover shorter distances with higher bandwidth
	- *Point-to-Multipoint* - connects a single base station to many clients
	- *Point-to-Point* - connects two fixed base stations to each other
Other communication requirements cover much shorter distances
- *Near-field communication (NFC)* - covers distances measured in centimeters using electromagnetic induction
- *Bluetooth Networks* - cover distances of around 30 feet

**Mobile Device Security** - mobile devices store and process sensitive information and must be secured, four-digit passcodes do not provide adequate security, use a complex alphanumeric passcode instead, biometric authentication offers a convenient, secure alternative access method
- *Full-Device Encryption* - protects sensitive information
Remote wiping technology removes data from lost or stolen devices, lock mobile devices automatically after a period of inactivity, push notifications are often used in multifactor authentication

**Mobile Device Management**
- *Mobile Device Management (MDM) Solutions* - manage settings across many mobile devices, unified endpoint management (UEM) solutions manage both mobile and fixed devices
	- MDM Features:
		- Performs device-configuration management
		- Prevents users from modifying security settings
		- Controls data stored on devices
		- Manage applications installed on devices
	- *Application Block Lists* - prohibit the installation of specified applications on mobile devices
	- *Application Allow Lists* - only allow the installation of approved applications on mobile devices
	- *Storage Segmentation* - separates sensitive information
	MDM solutions also provide content filtering and management

**Mobile Device Tracking** - organizations need to track the location of mobile devices, the loss of mobile devices introduces confidentiality and financial risks
- *Asset-Tracking Software* - manages device inventories
- *Geolocation* - allows the real-time and historical location of GPS enabled devices
- *Geofencing* - alerts when a device leaves a defined area
- GPS Use Limits:
	- Limited access to GPS data
	- Ability for monitored individual to disable tracking
	- Automated disabling outside working hours
	- Clear disclosure of use

**Mobile Application Security** - applications are a core part of the mobile user experience, applications process sensitive data and must have strong security controls
- *Authentication*:
	- Use strong credential management
	- Rely on central authentication
	Using external authentication places great trust in external providers
- Encrypt Sensitive Information:
	- Encrypt information in transit
	- Encrypt information at rest
	- Practice strong key management
- *Geotagging* - may disclose sensitive locations

**Mobile Security Enforcement** - mobile devices contain constantly evolving features, MDM solutions allow the lockdown of mobile device configurations, third-party app stores may contain unsafe code, jailbreaking phones creates added security risks, mobile devices must be patched with current operating system firmware, device unlocking allows portability among service providers
- Restricting Device Feature Use:
	- Cameras
	- Messaging
	- External media
	- USB On-The-Go
	- Microphone
	- GPS tagging
	- Wi-Fi usage
	- Device tethering/hotspots
	- Mobile payments

**Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)** - employees want to use personal devices for business purposes, this approach is known as bring your own device (BYOD), marks a radical shift in philosophy, Gartner predicts that within the next two years, half of all employers will require BYOD
- BYOD Policy Issues:
	- Who may bring devices to the workplace?
	- What devices may they bring?
	- How will the security of those devices be managed?
- BYOD Legal and Privacy Issues:
	- Users should understand monitoring
	- User acceptance of intrusive monitoring is unlikely
	- Organizations should obtain legal advice before implementing policies
- *BYOD Onboarding* - ensure the device meets security requirements and is safely configured
- *BYOD Offboarding* - remove all corporate information from the personally owned device
Consider the impact of BYOD on the organization's technology infrastructure
- BYOD Technical Issues:
	- Mobile device management
	- Patching and antivirus management
	- Camera use
	- Forensic procedures

**Mobile Deployment Models**
- *Choose Your Own Device (CYOD)* - users select devices, limit corporate control of devices, CYOD strategies normally provide users with a menu of devices from which to choose
- *Corporate-Owned, Personally Enabled (COPE)* - allows personal use of corporate devices
MDM provides a policy enforcement mechanism
- *Virtual Desktop Infrastructure* - desktops in the cloud or data center
