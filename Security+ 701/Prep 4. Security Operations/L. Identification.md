**Identification, Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting** - authorized users gain access through the process of identification, authentication, and authorization, remember that identification and authentication are separate and distinct steps
- *Accounting* - tracks user activity
Identity and access management systems should work across cloud and on premises environments

**Usernames and Access Cards** - identification mechanisms uniquely identify each user of a system
- Usernames:
	- Usually easily identify the individual
	- Often consist of a first initial and last name
	- Should not be considered secret
- Access Cards:
	- Often serve as proof of employment
	- May perform both identification and authentication

**Biometrics** - biometric authentication uses "something you are" authentication approaches
- Good Biometric Systems Provide:
	- Easy enrollment
	- Low false acceptance rates
	- Low false rejection rates
	- Low intrusiveness
- *Fingerprint Scans* - often found on computing devices, allow self-enrollment, low false rejection and acceptance rates
- *Eye Scans* - analyze color patterns of iris, analyze blood vessels of retina, seen as highly intrusive by users
- *Voiceprint Matching* - requires user to speak a phrase, subject to replay attacks, often combined with other authentication techniques
- *Facial Recognition* - scans user's facial structure, has a high "creepiness factor", improving error rates

**Registration and Identity Proofing** - registration and identity proofing establish an individual's identity and create their system account(s)
- Registration Process
	1. Request
	2. Approval
	3. Identity Proofing
	4. Issuance
	Separation of duties is critical in the registration process
Identity proofing must be performed carefully
- Identity Proofing Steps:
	- Photo identification (multiple forms)
	- Fingerprinting
	- Background checks
