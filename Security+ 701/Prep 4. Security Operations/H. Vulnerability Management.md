**What is Vulnerability Management** - software is complex, Linux kernel contains over 24 million lines of code, thousands of lines change every day, flaws in code lead to security vulnerabilities
- Vulnerability Patching Process:
	1. The company learns of a vulnerability
	2. Developers analyze the issue and develop a patch
	3. The company releases the patch to customers
	4. Customers apply the patch to remediate the vulnerability
Most organizations have many different components that require frequent security patches
- *Vulnerability Management* - detects, remediates, and reports vulnerabilities
	- Why Manage Vulnerabilities:
		- Maintain system security
		- Comply with corporate policy
		- Comply with regulatory requirements
			- PCI DSS Requirements:
				- Conduct quarterly internal and external vulnerability scans
				- Repeat scans after any significant change
				- Use an approved scanning vendor (ASV)
				- Remediate and rescan until you achieve a clean report
			- FISMA Requirements:
				- Conduct vulnerability scans regularly
				- Analyze the results of scans
				- Remediate legitimate vulnerabilities
				- Share information with other agencies
Supplement vulnerability scans with configuration and log reviews

**Identify Scan Targets** - you'll need to develop a list of the specific systems and devices you will scan
- *Asset Inventory* - provides the starting point for vulnerability scanning, vulnerability scanners can generate system inventories, you need an asset inventory even if you choose to scan all of your systems

**Scan Perspective** - scan results may differ based on the scan perspective, different scan perspectives bring different value to analysts, firewall settings, IDS/IPS rules, and network segmentation all impact scan results
- *Agent-Based Scanning* - installs software on each target device
- *Credential Scanning* - uses passwords to log in to systems

**Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP)**
- *Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP)* - set of standards to describe environments, vulnerabilities, and remediation steps using consistent language
	- SCAP Components:
		- Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
		- Common Configuration Enumeration (CCE)
		- Common Platform Enumeration (CPE)
		- Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)
		- Extensible Configuration Checklist Description Format (XCCDF)
		- Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language (OVAL)

**Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)**
- *CVSS* - scores vulnerabilities on a 10-point scale
	- Attack Vector (AV):
		- *Physical (P)* - requires physical touch/manipulation
		- *Local (L)* - requires physical or logical console access
		- *Adjacent Network (A)* - requires local network access
		- *Network (N)* - remotely exploitable
	- Attack Complexity (AC):
		- *High (H)* - requires specialized conditions
		- *Low (L)* - does not require specialized conditions
	- Privileges Required (PR):
		- *High (H)* - requires administrative control
		- *Low (L)* - requires basic user privileges
		- *None (N)* - requires no prior privileges
	- User Interaction (UI):
		- *Required (R)* - requires that a user take some action
		- *None (N)* - does not require user interaction
	The AV, AC, PR, and UI metrics combine to describe the **exploitability** of a vulnerability
	- Confidentiality (C):
		- *None (N)* - no confidentiality impact
		- *Low (L)* - possible access to some information
		- *High (H)* - compromise of all information
	- Integrity (I):
		- *None (N)* - no integrity impact
		- *Low (L)* - possible modification of some information
		- *High (H)* - compromise of all information
	- Availability (A):
		- *None (N)* - no availability impact
		- *Low (L)* - degraded performance
		- *High (H)* - shutdown of system
	The C, I, and A metrics combine to describe the **impact** of a vulnerability
	- Scope (S):
		- *Changed (C)* - exploiting the vulnerability can affect other components
		- *Unchanged (U)* - exploiting the vulnerability only affects resources managed by the same security authority

**Analyzing Scan Reports** - cybersecurity analysts need to present different information to different audiences
- Prioritization Factors:
	- Vulnerability severity
	- System criticality
	- Information sensitivity
	- Remediation difficulty
	- Environmental variables
- *Vulnerability Validation* - confirms accuracy

Vulnerability Outcomes:

|               | Vulnerability Reported | Vulnerability Not Reported |
| ------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Exists        | ==True Positive==      | False Negative             |
| Doesn't Exist | False Positive         | ==True Negative==          |


**Correlating Scan Results** - correlate scan results with other sources of information, consult industry standards, best practices, and compliance requirements, PCI DSS CVSS Scores, Technical Information Sources, Trend Analysis
- Technical Information Sources:
	- Configuration management systems
	- Log repositories
	- Other data sources

**Vulnerability Response and Remediation** - vulnerabilities in systems are like cracks in the foundation of a house
- Vulnerability Remediation:
	- Patching affected system(s)
	- Segmenting networks
	- Implementing compensating controls
	- Seeking exceptions or exemptions
Cybersecurity insurance mitigates financial and operational impacts
- Validation of Remediation:
	- Rescanning affected system(s)
	- Auditing
	- Verification
