**Penetration Testing**
- *Penetration Testing* - places security professionals in the role of attackers, the goal of a penetration test is to successfully defeat security controls
	- Penetration Test Categories:
		- Physical penetration testing
		- Offensive penetration testing
		- Defensive penetration testing
		- Integrated penetration testing
	Document the rules of engagement before beginning a penetration test
	- Three Types of Penetration Testing Environments:
		- *Known Environment* - attacks have full access to information before they begin the test
		- *Partially Known Environment* - attackers have limited information before they begin the test
		- *Unknown Environment* - attackers have no information about the target before they begin the test
	- *Warflying* - takes wardriving to the air with drones and UAVs
	- *Pivot* - after exploiting a vulnerability in a system, attackers use that system as a base from which to target other systems on the same local network
	- *Persistence* - after exploiting a vulnerability in a system, attackers install tools on that system to allow future access - even if the initial vulnerability is corrected
	Clean up at the end of the attack, penetration tests provide valuable insight, but they are labor-intensive

**Responsible Disclosure** - security professionals sometimes discover new vulnerabilities in the course of their work
- *Zero-Day Vulnerability* - no public knowledge or patch
The window of vulnerability begins with the initial discovery of an issue and ends with the successful deployment of a patch
- Vulnerability Disclosure Options:
	- Share privately with the vendor
	- Share publicly with the security community
	- Keep knowledge for personal use or sale
	Without public pressure, vendors might not fix a vulnerability
- *Responsible Disclosure* - share newly discovered vulnerabilities with the vendor first, providing them with a deadline after which the vulnerability will be publicly disclosed

**Bug Bounty**
- *Bug Bounty Programs* - open security testing, bug bounty programs allow you to harness the work of hackers for your own purposes, vendors offer both self-managed and fully managed bounty programs, bug bounty programs increase the strength of your security defenses
Logs show that attackers probe systems on a continuous basis, many of these attacks are simply automated scans probing for vulnerabilities
