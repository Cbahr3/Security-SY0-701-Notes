**Configuration Management**
- *Configuration Management* - tracks specific device settings
	- *Baselines* - provide a configuration snapshot
	- *Versioning* - assigns numbers to each version
Diagrams serve as important configuration artifacts
- Standardize Device Configurations:
	- Naming conventions
	- IP addressing schemes
Change and configuration management help ensure a stable operating environment

**Physical Asset Management** - maintaining control of physical assets begins with an asset inventory, asset management should follow a lifecycle approach, first, a user requests a new hardware device through the acquisition/procurement process, the receiving clerk updates the inventory and assigns the hardware to an IT staff member, either the receiving clerk or the IT staff member affixes a hardware asset tag, the IT staff member configures the device and assigns it to an owner, who may then use the device for years, the device is reassigned to another user or properly disposed of
- *Device Enumeration* - probes the network looking for devices that are not actively managed
- *Media Management* - tracks highly sensitive data

**Disposal and Decommissioning** - erasing a file doesn't completely remove data from the disk
- *Disk Sanitization Programs* - overwrite the data stored on disk
Overwriting must be performed by the cloud provider
- *Crypto-shredding* - deletes decryption keys
Physical destruction may be used if a device is no longer needed, obtain certification of destruction by vendors, comply with data retention policies
