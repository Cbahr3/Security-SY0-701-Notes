 CIA triad - **Confidentiality** - protect information from unauthorized access, **Integrity** - protect from unauthorized changes, and **Availability** - ensure that systems are available for users when *needed*

**Identification** - assertion or claim of personhood, username, **Authentication** - person proves their identity, password, **Authorization** - checks to see if you're allowed to access a system, access control lists - file permissions, **Accounting** - allows tracking of user behavior and what they access

**Defense in Depth** - multiple controls for one objective

Types of controls - [preventive, detective, corrective, deterrent, directive, compensating]

**Technical controls** - use technology to achieve security control objectives, *Operational Controls* - use human-driven processes to manage technology in a secure manner, *Managerial Controls* - improve the security of risk management process itself, *Physical Controls* - fences, gates, etc.

**Gap Analysis** - Desired State vs. Current State, helps develop roadmap for remediation

**ZTNA (Zero Trust)** - applies least privilege to network access, strong authentication and identity management practices, role based management, *Control Plane* - makes network policy decisions, *Data Plane* - enforces network policy decisions, adaptive identity, threat scope reduction, implicit trust zones

**SASE (Secure Access Service Edge)** - Software-defined networking (SDN), ZTNA, Cloud access security brokers (CASBs), Firewall as a service (FWaaS), other network security services

**Physical Access Control** - Locks - hardware (physical) keys, cipher locks, biometric, card readers, prone to tailgating - solution is to use two doors, Facility Monitoring - Motion, noise, pressure, microwave, ultrasonic sensors, video surveillance, fences, cages, bollards, proper lighting, signs, industrial camouflage, drones and UAVs make security difficult

**Physical Security Personnel** - Receptionists may act as security guards, a menacing look is sometimes desirable, Two-Person Integrity - two people must enter sensitive areas together, Two-Person Control - requires two people to perform an action

**Deception Technologies** - *Darknets* - unused but monitored IP address spaces, Honeytokens - fake records inserted into databases, *Honeyfiles* - false stores of sensitive information, *Honeypots* - systems designed to attract and trap attackers, *Honeynets* - Large-scale deployments of honeypots, *DNS Sinkhole* - altered DNS records to reroute botnet traffic

**Change Management** - Plans, implements, and monitors changes to protect organizations from unforeseen consequences, well-defined approval process, ownership should be clearly defined, identify and engage stakeholders, conduct an impact analysis, test changes and review test results, have a back-out plan ready to go in the event of issues, deploy changes during planned maintenance windows. adhere to standard operating procedures, Technical Limitations - Allow lists/deny lists, restricted activities, downtime, service/application restarts, legacy applications, dependencies, Version Control - provides traceability, documents purpose, scope. and details of every modification to help revert changes, detect vulnerabilities, and conduct audits
